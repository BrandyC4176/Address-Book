# Project Name: Address Book

## Project Description

This project is a multi-week Java application designed to demonstrate core object-oriented programming principles and structured software development. The goal is to build a functional Rolodex-style contacts manager that evolves each week, incorporating inheritance, interfaces, abstraction, constructors, access specifiers, and finally full database persistence using SQLite. The application allows users to store, view, update, and delete contact information across several contact types, creating a practical and extendable digital Rolodex.

## Project Tasks

* **Task 1: Initial application setup (Week 1)**

  * Create the basic console interface and core class structure
  * Demonstrate inheritance and composition with multiple contact types

* **Task 2: Implement interfaces and polymorphism (Week 2)**

  * Add interface-based behavior for display formatting
  * Expand class hierarchy to support consistent polymorphic operations

* **Task 3: Add abstraction, constructors, and access specifiers (Week 3)**

  * Convert the base Contact class to an abstract class
  * Add multiple constructors and ensure proper encapsulation

* **Task 4: Integrate SQLite and full CRUD functionality (Week 4)**

  * Build a DAO layer for database operations
  * Support adding, reading, updating, and deleting contacts
  * Persist multiple contact types using a unified table design

* **Task 5: Testing and refinement**

  * Test all features after each stage
  * Debug issues related to input handling, object creation, and SQL queries

* **Task 6: Document and finalize**

  * Prepare the README and code documentation
  * Ensure project meets all performance assessment requirements

## Project Skills Learned

* Object-oriented programming: inheritance, interfaces, abstraction
* Constructor overloading and encapsulation
* SQLite database integration with JDBC
* CRUD application design
* Separation of concerns and multi-file project organization
* Debugging and iterative refinement of Java applications

## Language Used

* **Java** — chosen for its strong OOP capabilities and compatibility with SQLite via JDBC.

## Development Process Used

* **Iterative, step-based development** modeled after an Agile mindset

  * Build features in weekly increments
  * Test and refine code continuously
  * Expand functionality based on prior week’s design
